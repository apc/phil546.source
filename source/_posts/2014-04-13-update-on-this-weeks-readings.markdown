I have made a small adjustment to our reading schedule. In addition to Pietroski's paper, we will be talking about Agust√≠n Rayo's 'Vague Representation'. 

If you can only read one of the papers, please read Rayo's. Pietroski's paper gives a useful overview of some of the issues we discussed last week, so I strongly recommend you read it as well.
