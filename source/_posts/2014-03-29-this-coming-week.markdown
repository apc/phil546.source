I've posted the readings for this coming week. There is a fair bit of material there, so I thought I'd give you some directions. Focus mostly on Dummett's article. Louise's paper will help guide some of the discussion of this week and the next, so don't worry if you can't read all of it for this week. 

If you have never read the Davidson, you may at least want to take a look at the section titled "[Meaning and Truth](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/#Tru)" in the "[Stanford Encyclopedia](http://plato.stanford.edu/)" entry on Davidson.
